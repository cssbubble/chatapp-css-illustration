## My process
- Really it was challenging project. As always I was struggling with backgroud image but that struggle made me learn it. First I made top left background image. Then I made mobile image entirely using html and Css . I learnd a lot positioning properties, couple of times my code broke too. Then I made the main title and paragraph. And lastly made bottom background image. Then the layout broke again, and I fixed it by changing the position of the background div.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Tailwind css](https://tailwindcss.com) - tailwind css


### What I learned

- background image

- media query
- overall positioning
